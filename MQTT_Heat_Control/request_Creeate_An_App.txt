Can you create an expo,React Native,javaScript 
(not javatypeScript) App, that has a MqttService.js component.
this component should connect to the HiveMQ broker cluster,with
a userName and Password of:
userName: "Tortoise"
Password: "Hea1951Ter"
url:"c846e85af71b4f65864f7124799cd3bb.s1.eu.hivemq.cloud".
I want the App.js component to create a line chart with three
lines that should be colour coded, one for outside temperature 
one for coolside temperature and one for heater.
the "Y" axis will be for the temperature in 1Ëš increments,
the "X" axis will be for the time.
I want to be able to scroll the line, the line should be able to
scroll independant to the boddy  
the App.component should be able to store the data and retreive
the data when the user scrolls the line
the App.js should supscribe to 4 topics "outSide", "coolSide",
"heater", and time.
